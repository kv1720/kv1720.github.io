    <h3> My life story: </h3>
    <p>
      Growing up, I struggled with finding my voice. Being surrounded by self-centered people and distant family did
      not necessarily make my transition to womanhood easy. I was bullied, nagged at, and pushed to my very last nerve -
      but I did not let imprudent people antagonize me. I was taught from a very young age that sometimes you
      need to lose some people in your life to be able to find yourself and fully become indepedent.
      I live each day building myself to the best person I can be, and being unapologetically me.
    </p>

    <h3> My post-graduate goals: </h3>
    <p>
      In revolutionizing marine studies, it is important to act locally at the community level while
      also thinking globally.
      The aspect of thinking globally and acting locally personally motivates me to achieve my career goals
      and sustain my lifetime goal of marine conservation activism. I want to be able to help underserved
      communities find ways they can contribute to the effort of saving marine biodiversity from their homes.
      Upon graduating from Wellesley College, I plan to get a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology from Wellesley College
      and a Doctorate degree in Marine Biology at Boston University.

    <h3> My biggest inspiration: </h3>
    <p>
      Someone I look up to is my aunt, Juliana. She is the strongest person I know and has faced
      many tribulations in life with a triumphant attitude. She looks out for her children and makes sure that they have
      everything they need. Immigrating from the Dominican Republic at 15 fifteen years old, my aunt went under a lot
      of pressure to provide for her family being the oldest out of seven children. Until this day, my aunt makes
      sacrifices for her loved ones without expecting much in return. She looks out for her children and makes sure that they have.
