    <h3> My childhood: </h3>
    <p class="bio">
      Growing up, I struggled a lot with being comfortable with who I was. I was very shy and anti-social and was bullied throughout elementary school and middle school because no one understood me, or atleast tried to. I remember being obsessed with how I can change myself to get attention but really I wanted to show the world how bright and vibrant I was. Eventually, I found passion for reading and writing stories which made me stand out from the crowd. I no longer cared about fitting in or what people had to say to me, instead, I focused on growing and bettering myself. Becoming the master of my soul enabled me to see that people could only rule and step over me if I let them. I chose happiness instead.

    <h3> My role models: </h3>
    <p class="inspiration">
      My older sister, aunt, and older cousins inspire me to continue to have goals for myself and do my best in school. Without them, I would not be half the woman I am today. I appreciate them for being there at every downfall and every triumph, and making every important event in my life so far memorable.

    <h3> My post-graduate goals: </h3>
    <p class="career">
      Attending a liberal arts college has given me the freedom to explore my interests and the endless possibilities to shape my future. All my life, I wanted to contribute to the effort of protecting our environment. By the time I graduate college, I aspire to become a spokesperson for marine conservation activism around the world and help global underserved communities find resources and ways they can help save marine life. I plan to earn a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a PhD in Marine Biology.
